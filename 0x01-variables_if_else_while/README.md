# C - Variables, if, else, while

## Mandatory Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is netter than negative nothing

- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It will print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

### 1. The last digit

- This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It will print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
- File: `1-last_digit.c`

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

- This program prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a line.
	-> Only uses the `putchar` function
	-> All code is in the `main` function
	-> `putchar` is used only twice in the code
- File: `2-print_alphabet.c`

### 3. alphABET

This program prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a line.
        -> Only uses the `putchar` function
        -> All code is in the `main` function
        -> `putchar` is used only thrice in the code
- File: `3-print_alphabets.c`

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

- This program prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a line.
	-> Prints all letters except `q` and `e`
        -> Only uses the `putchar` function
        -> All code is in the `main` function
        -> `putchar` is used only twice in the code
- File: `4-print_alphabt.c`

### 5. Numbers

- This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
        -> All code is in the `main` function
- File: `5-print_numbers.c

### 6. Numberz

- This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
	-> No variable of type char is used
	-> Only putchar function is used (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) 
	-> `putchar`  is used twice in the code
	-> All the code is in the `main` function
- File: `6-print_numberz.c`

### 7. Smile in the mirror

- This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line
	-> Only `putchar` function is used (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	-> All the code is in the `main` function
	-> `putchar`  is used twice in the code
- File: `7-print_tebahpla.c`

### 8. Hexadecimal

- This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a line
	-> Only `putchar` function is used (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
        -> All the code is in the `main` function
        -> `putchar`  is used thrice in the code
- File: `8-print_base16.c`

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

- This program prints all possible combinations of single digit numbers
	-> Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space
	-> Numbers are printed in ascending order
	-> Only `putchar` function is used(every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	-> All the code is in the `main` function
	-> `putchar` is used four times maximum in the code
	-> Variable of type `char` is not used
- File: 9-print_comb.c
